# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer taking one day at a time.

I enjoy developing in Python, C/C++, Javascript, Rust, and Clojure.

I have career experience with Python, C++/C, C#, Java, and Clojure at the moment but I always like getting my hands dirty with new tools....

I am really into web development these days, I enjoy creating delightful experiences for users and with UI/UX I can do that directly (:

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering, and dive deep into my tabletop rpg campaigns.
