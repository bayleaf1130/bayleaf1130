# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer taking one day at a time. I am from the United States and I am also a Computer Science college graduate.

I enjoy developing in Python, C, Kotlin, Goalng, Rust, and Clojure.

I have career experience with Python, C, Kotlin and Clojure at the moment.

I think its important we pick tools for the situation so I love learning lots of things.

Currently, I am teaching myself Rust and Golang in hopes that I can replace C for my systems projects... and I enjoy them both quite a bit for different reasons.

I really like working on backend development and projects related to the system level tooling or software emulation/graphics.

Check out my blog [Bumbling Bayleaf](https://bumblingbayleaf.com) (there really is not much here, I just tried to teach myself bootstrap/javascript really)

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering and dive deep into my D&D campaigns.
