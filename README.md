# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer one day at a time. I am from the United States and I am also a Computer Science college graduate.

I enjoy developing in Python, C, and Clojure.

Currently, I am teaching myself Golang in hopes that I can replace C for my systems projects (:

I really like working on backend development and projects related to the command line or software emulation/graphics.

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering and dive deep into my D&D campaigns.
