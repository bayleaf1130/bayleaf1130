# About me
Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer one day at a time. I am from the United States and I am also a Computer Science college graduate.

I enjoy developing in Python, C, and Clojure.

I really like working on backend development and projects related to the command line or software emulation/graphics.

## My hobbies
I really like to climb big rocks.
