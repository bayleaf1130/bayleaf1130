# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer taking one day at a time.

I enjoy developing in Python, Clojure, Javascript, and Golang!

I am really into web development these days, I enjoy creating delightful experiences for users and with UI/UX I can do that directly (:

I am not adverse to facing tough challenges in any programming language however, puzzles are quite fun!

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering, and dive deep into my tabletop rpg campaigns.
