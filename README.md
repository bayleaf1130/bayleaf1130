# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer taking one day at a time. I am from the United States and I am also a Computer Science college graduate.

I enjoy developing in Python, C, Kotlin, and Clojure.

I have career experience with Python, C++, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure at the moment but I always like getting my hands dirty with new tools....

Currently, I am teaching myself Rust and Golang in hopes that I can replace C for my systems projects... and I enjoy them both quite a bit for different reasons.

I really like working on backend development and projects related to the system level tooling or software emulation/graphics.

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering, and dive deep into my D&D campaigns.
