# About me

Hi! I am Bayleaf, just another programmer taking it one day at a time.

I enjoy developing webapps with Clojure/Javascript or fun software with Rust/Golang but will get my hands dirty with whatever.

I am always looking for freelance/contract work so feel free to reach out on LinkedIn with the link below

## My hobbies

I really like to climb big rocks, spend too much money on magic the gathering, and dive deep into my tabletop rpg campaigns.
